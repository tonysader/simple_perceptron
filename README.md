# simple_perceptron
Create simple perceptron and train it with the inputs you want. save the network in your browser and load it again later.
      If you want to train perceptron to classify inputs correctly,
        which is building Single-layer Neural Network, You came to the  right place. <br>
        Here you can select the inputs you want with the number you want.<br>
        You can select as much as training set as you want, the same thing with the testing sets to test your neural network.<br>
        The activation function here is step function which will output 0 or 1 based on the bias, inputs and the weights.<br>
        The weights will start automatically as 0.<br>
        You can choose the bias and the educational rate that will train the network.<br>
        You can enter the maximum number of iterations you want.<br>
        You can save the network to use it in another time. It will be saved on your browser<br>
